# BillsForKids: A Fun Financial Education Game

## Overview
BillsForKids is an interactive Java application designed to teach children basic financial concepts through a gamified experience. This project demonstrates the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and showcases various Java programming concepts.

## Project Structure
The application is structured using the MVC pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic
    - `Allowance.java`
    - `Bill.java`
    - `Job.java`
    - `Piggybank.java`
    - `Savings.java`

- **View**: Handles the user interface
    - `BillsForKidsView.java`

- **Controller**: Manages the flow of data between Model and View
    - `BillsForKidsController.java`

## Key Features
1. Collect allowance
2. Pay bills
3. Save money
4. Spend money
5. Check finances
6. Work a job
7. Pass days

## MVC Implementation
- **Model**: Contains the core logic for financial operations.
- **View**: Provides a colorful, child-friendly GUI using Swing.
- **Controller**: Coordinates actions between the Model and View.

### Benefits of MVC
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct responsibility.
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to update or replace individual components.
3. **Reusability**: Models can be used with different views or controllers.
4. **Flexibility**: Allows for easy expansion of features.

## Java Concepts Demonstrated
1. Object-Oriented Programming
2. Swing GUI Development
3. Event Handling
4. Exception Handling
5. File I/O (for potential save/load features)
6. Collections Framework
7. Interfaces and Abstract Classes

## Learning Outcomes
This project showcases my understanding of:
- Java syntax and core concepts
- Software design patterns (MVC)
- GUI development in Java
- Event-driven programming
- Basic financial concepts and their implementation in code

## Future Enhancements
- Implement data persistence (save/load game state)
- Add more interactive elements and mini-games
- Introduce difficulty levels for different age groups
- Develop a mobile version using Android

## Conclusion
BillsForKids demonstrates my ability to apply Java programming concepts learned in school to create a practical, educational application. It reflects my understanding of software architecture, user interface design, and the implementation of business logic in a cohesive application.
